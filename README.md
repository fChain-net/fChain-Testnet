mChain (short for MemeChain) is a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain designed around a single core idea: fully eliminating transaction fees without sacrificing performance or security. Instead of relying on per-transaction gas fees, mChain is funded through a fixed monthly network subscription paid by users and applications. This subscription pool covers validator incentives, infrastructure costs, and ongoing protocol development, allowing all on-chain activity to be free at the point of use. As network adoption increases, the cost of the subscription is distributed across a larger user base, causing the effective price per user to decrease over time.

From a technical perspective, mChain is engineered for high throughput and extremely fast finality. The network targets sustained throughput in the range of 250,000 transactions per second with burst capacity exceeding 1 million transactions per second, supported by parallel transaction execution and a high-performance proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Block times are designed to be approximately 100 milliseconds, with transaction finality typically achieved within 300–500 milliseconds. Smart contract execution is initially EVM-compatible, allowing existing tooling and contracts to migrate with minimal friction while benefiting from zero-fee execution.

By removing gas fees entirely, mChain enables use cases that are impractical on traditional blockchains, including high-frequency applications, on-chain games, social platforms, AI agents, and micro-transactions at internet scale. Developers gain predictable costs with no gas estimation or fee optimization logic, while users interact with applications without concern for network congestion or transaction pricing. mChain positions itself as a general-purpose blockchain optimized for mass adoption, where economic alignment comes from shared network growth rather than competition over blockspace.
