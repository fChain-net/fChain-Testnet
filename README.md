Gitr.fun sets itself apart from every other memecoin launchpad by tying tokens directly to GitHub repos. Unlike Twitter-based or anonymous launchers where anyone can impersonate someone else, Gitr ensures 100% authenticity because coins can only be created by connecting a real GitHub account and repo. That means no larped projects, no fake socials — just verifiable repos linked on-chain. This creates true transparency and makes discovery easier for traders and builders. Looking ahead, Gitr will integrate GitHub wallet ownership, allowing fees and revenue from launched coins to be sent directly to repo owners. This bridges crypto with open-source development, turning GitHub itself into a trust layer for memecoins and beyond.
